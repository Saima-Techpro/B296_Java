         Task 1:
        Write a Java method that takes an ArrayList<String> as input and returns a new
        ArrayList<String> with the elements in reverse order.
        You are not allowed to use any built-in reverse method.

         Task 2:
        Write a Java method that takes an ArrayList<Integer>  and returns the element that appears
        the most times in the list. If there are multiple elements with the same highest frequency,
        return the first one that appears in the list.

        Real life implementation:
        Imagine you are running a customer survey for a new product, and customers are rating the product
        on a scale of 1 to 5. Youâ€™ve collected the survey responses and stored the ratings in an ArrayList<Integer>.
        Now, you want to find out which rating was given most frequently, so you can understand the general
        sentiment of your customers.
